1. Update LB to use port 80.
2. LB should output the dns url, prepend "http://"
3. If the student provides a URL to verify his work is running properly, it will be a page that says “it works! Udagram, Udacity”
4. Upload that page to the s3 bucket:  aws s3 cp s3://udacity-demo-1/udacity.zip .
5. Create an image that would be used in the launch configuration.

Create:
./create_stack.sh udacity-ha-solution-network network.yml network-parameters.json 
./create_stack.sh udacity-ha-solution-servers servers.yml server-parameters.json 

Update:
./update_stack.sh udacity-ha-solution-network network.yml network-parameters.json 
./update_stack.sh udacity-ha-solution-servers servers.yml server-parameters.json 

Delete:
./delete_stack udacity-ha-solution-network
./delete_stack udacity-ha-solution-servers
